## I. Introduction
In this project, we developed several machine learning models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the [IMDb Dataset of Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crisbam/imdb-dataset-of-65k-movie-reviews-and-translation).
Our workflow included data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection, model building and tuning. We concluded by visualizing feature contributions and explaining predictions for logistic regression, the best-performing model.
The dataset contains 150,000 movie reviews and 14,206 unique movie titles, sourced from [Kaggle], with a total size of 384.06 MB in CSV format. Each entry includes:
•	**Rating:** User rating from 1 to 10.
•	**Review:** User review in English.
•	**Movie:** Name of the movie.
•	**Resenhas:** Portuguese translation of the reviews.
Since our focus was on English reviews, we excluded the Portuguese ones.
